# WatermarkApplicator
Built with Tkinter and PLT. A simple desktop GUI that allows user to upload a target image and watermark image. The script than automatically applies the watermark to top left of the targeted image.  The user is then given a preview of how the image would look and allowed to save the image(given they must manually type the extension).



UPDATE PLANS:
1) Better GUI layout
2) Allow user to edit where watermark is placed and how large they wish the watermark to be.
4) Allow user to resize targeted image?
5) Allow user to resize final image.
